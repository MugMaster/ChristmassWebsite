	<h1>
		Merry Christmas Mom and Dad! <br> <br>
		I couldn`t keep to just a card as per usual, <br>
		but this time I have more characters! <br>
	</h1>

	<br><br>

	<h2>
		<br>
		I have so much to thank you guys for between helping me get my license, <br>
		to taking me to Mexico where I didn`t even get heat-exhaustion! <br>
		This has been a difficult year and I`m glad to have you guys <br>
		by my side, I`m not sure what I`d do without you. <br>
		<br>
	</h2>

	<br><br>

	<h1>
		Mom, <br>
		Thank you for: <br>
		- Taking me to driver z and both my tests <br>
		- Relaying my concerns with math class to the school <br>
		- Taking me to the hospital, even if it was a little overdue <br>
	</h1>

	<br><br>

	<h2>
		<br>
		Dad, <br>
		Thank you for: <br>
		- Discussing my weird physics questions <br>
		- Helping me build my mini computer (the one that looks like an ied) <br>
		- Helping me plan out my future schooling <br>
		<br>
	</h2>

	<h1>
		Keeping with the theme of giving experiences this year, <br>
		I`ve gotten Mom two tickets to The Leaf and <br>
		Dad I`ve gotten us tickets to Monster Jam. <br>
		And don`t worry Mom, I haven't forgotten about Detroit Become Human, <br>
		just let me know when you want to play. <br>
	</h1>

	<br><br>

	<h2>
		<br>
		To make this card I learnt: CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, <br>
		I expect to make more cards like this in the future and <br>
		probably a personal data storage website for myself. <br>
		I hope you liked this card as much as I loved making it, <br> <br>
		love you guys and have an amazing Christmas! <br>
